## About
I wanted to have an app on the tvOS App store in its first month of existence. This is not necessarily the most useful app you'll ever download, but it is peaceful, relaxing, and (I think) well written.

** image **
A fireplace will appear on screen, along with a simple guide for navigation, and two audio tracks playing in the background.

### Video Adjustment
* Double tap the main button on your Apple TV remote to switch between one of three fireplace videos.
* Single tap the main button on your Apple TV remote to show/hide the navigation guide.

### Volume Adjustment
* Swipe left/right on your remote to adjust the music volume.
* Swipe up/down on your remote to adjust the rain volume.

There is a first **and** second rule disallowing me from telling you where I got this idea as a whole, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless. And if you know where it's from, I made this for you.

## Contributions
If you think some of this app can be written in a better way, please feel free to make a branch from master and submit a pull request. This is a fairly infantile idea, but if you think it can grow in any way.
